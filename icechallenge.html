The ALS Association has demonstrated a strong track record of keeping fundraising and administration costs low and expenses on programs and services to fulfill our 
mission high. We are proud to have received the highest ratings from Charity Navigator, Charity Watch, the Better Business Bureau and GuideStar.

New research projects across the country dedicated to solving ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, have begun to receive millions of dollars in additional
 funding thanks to this year’s Ice Bucket Challenge. The funding marks the ALS Association’s first move toward distributing the $115 million it raised to fight the
 disease.

“We are tripling the amount annually that we spend on research,” said ALS Association President Barbara Newhouse.
 “We have a sense of urgency, but we also we recognize that we have to be good stewards of the donor dollars as we move this forward as quickly as researchers can 
research.”
