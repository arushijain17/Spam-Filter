urbanization, the process by which large numbers of people become permanently concentrated in relatively small areas, forming cities.

The definition of what constitutes a city changes from time to time and place to place, but it is most usual to explain the term as a matter of demographics. The United Nations has recommended that countries regard all places with more than 20,000 inhabitants living close together as urban; but, in fact, nations compile their statistics on the basis of many different standards. The United States, for instance, uses “urban place” to mean any locality where more than 2,500 people live.

Whatever the numerical definition, it is clear that the course of human history has been marked by a process of accelerated urbanization. It was not until the Neolithic period, roughly 10,000 years ago, that humans were able to form permanent settlements. Even 5,000 years ago the only such settlements on the globe were small, semipermanent villages of peasant farmers, towns whose size was limited by the fact that they had to move whenever the soil nearby was exhausted. It was not until the time of classical antiquity that cities of more than 100,000 existed, and even these did not become common until the sustained population explosion of the last three centuries. In 1800 less than 3 percent of the world’s population was living in cities of 20,000 or more; this had increased to about one-quarter of the population by the mid-1960s. By the end of the 20th century nearly half of the world’s population resided in cities of 20,000 or more.

The little towns of ancient civilizations, both in the Old World and the New, were only possible because of improvements in agriculture and transportation. As farming became more productive, it produced a surplus of food. The development of means of transportation, dating from the invention of the wheel in about 3500 bc, made it possible for the surplus from the countryside to feed urban populations, a system that continues to the present day.
